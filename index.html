      <h2>üíº My Self</h2>
      <p>
        I am a passionate and dedicated Software Engineering student currently pursuing my degree from GIFT University. I have a strong interest in full-stack web development and game development, with hands-on experience in creating real-world projects using technologies like the MERN stack and Unity (3D). I enjoy solving problems, learning new tools, and working both independently and in collaborative teams to build engaging and effective software solutions.
